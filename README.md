The Vasicek model is a specific application of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the context of interest rate modeling. I explained the Kalman filter and Kalman smoother. By using the Kalman filter and smoother for state estimation, I simulated and estimated parameters for the Vasicek model.  https://youtu.be/V9uJQ5Tt3gA
